Hello, is this thing on?

Hi, I'm back after 3 months of absolute silence. I hope you're doing
well despite these trying times.

# Yet another new writing platform, really?

Look, I really did believe [Writefreely](https://writefreely.org/) will be the end of it all but
sadly, I ended up having mixed opinions about it.

This weekend, I found out that the entire thing broke on its own and
locked me out of my own drafts because of an update which adds OAuth
functionality, fun.

It lacks a lot of things that I consider good software require, most
notably, in this case: any form of update guides.

Seriously though, I thought that this software would allow me to write
stuff quickly but in reality, it doesn't.

# Back to Emacs, then

Recently, I'm back to Emacs with org-mode. However, unlike before, I'm
actually using something built-into org-mode rather than using
something like Hugo/Jekyll which has sub-par support.

Honestly, I feel dumb for not discovering thing much much earlier but
only a couple hours ago, I discovered [ox-publish.el](https://github.com/emacs-china/org-mode/blob/master/lisp/ox-publish.el) which adds
website publishing functionality to Org!

I just finished setting stuff up and migrated my old posts from the
awful Writefreely instance of this thing. While I was considering
migrating posts from [my old blog](https://blog.yukiisbo.red), I decided not to mainly because
it'll be a chore making it 'look' the same.

# General updates

I've been really busy these past months and will be busy for the next
couple more months with personal stuff.

However, I should have more free time in a couple of weeks which
should allow me to have much more intimate writing sessions and
overall more time for personal development.

# Writing Bucket list: Nix

I always been considering writing a blog post about Nix, the
package manager which utilizes the purely functional deployment model.

However, I don't think I'm experienced enough with Nix to be writing
posts about it, especially considering its intimate situation of
lacking major documentation.

Some people may think that I should _still_ write about it but I want to
write something extensive and in-depth about it because it truly
deserves the attention and care.

For now, if you're an introduction to Nix, I recommend the [Nix Pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/index.html)
series or even the original papers: [The Purely Functional Software
Deployment Model](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf), [NixOS: A Purely Functional Linux Distribution](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/nixos-jfp-final.pdf).

I describe the current situation with Nix to be similar to early
Haskell (pre-Real World Haskell) where you really need to dig through
papers, source code, mailing lists, etc. to find quality and accurate
information.

I really do hope someone out there is writing a book about Nix but I
could see why no one is currently doing it as it is still in
early-late development stages. Hopefully, it'll mature once [Nix Flakes](https://serokell.io/blog/practical-nix-flakes)
is not locked away behind the experimental gate :-)

# New computer setup

I replaced my desktop with a new lightweight 14" laptop. It's a Clevo
NV41MB which I bought from [PCW.fr](https://www.pcw.fr/portables-pro/2342-clevo-nv41-serie-pro-14-intel-tigerlake-11th-gen-video-intel-iris-graphics-a-gtx1650-ti.html). It's a pretty nice configuration
with 1 TB NVMe, 11th Gen Core i5, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM.

I'm running Windows 10 as the primary operating system, mainly because
I need to run a notable amount of applications that only run on
Windows.

Yes, Wine and Proton exists but sadly, they don't suffice with my
requirements.

On Windows, I use Windows Subsystem for Linux extensively to run Linux
applications, most notably GNU Emacs in GUI mode. I run [X410](https://x410.dev/) as my X11
server in order to enable GUI applications on WSL.

I know there's [WSLg](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg) but it's not ready for prime time, yet.

OpenBSD is installed as a secondary operating system that I use
sometimes. It runs quite stable, however, Intel Xe Graphics is known to
be buggy everywhere so yeah but surprisingly, a lot stabler than my
adventures with amdgpu, so that's something!

Also, yes, convieniences such as Wi-Fi, suspend, etc works fine as far
as I can tell. I have some annoyances with my keyboard not working
sometimes on X11 but I'm not sure if that's because I'm running my
keyboard via my Thunderbolt Dock or something else. Oh well.

# Anything else&#x2026;

Well, I don't know anything else that I would like to share in this
rather lengthy blog post but I'll just stop here.

See you later,

Yuki.
