In this article, we will explore the issues with traditional methods
of installing software.

This includes using distribution package managers such as apt, dnf,
pacman and third-party ones like MacPorts and Homebrew.

In addition, we will take a look at containerized solutions and their
issues.

# The problem with traditional software deployment

In the [Nix thesis](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf), [Eelco Dostra](https://edolstra.github.io/) potrayed how ancient the current
methods of software deployment is by comparing it to how software
developers used to manage and allocate memory in Assembly.

You don't need to know how memory is managed in Assembly as I will
illustrate the issue without even mentioning it.

The filesystem of a typical [\*nix system](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4715413) (i.e Linux, macOS) is
essentially free-form with loosely defined ["standards"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base) and
["conventions"](https://man.openbsd.org/hier.7) adopted by system administrators, software developers,
and package maintainers.

In this case, filesystem refers to how files are structured on your
system, like the `/bin/` folder contains program binaries and your
personal "home" folder is inside the `/home/` folder.

If you want to see how different this can be, see how files are
structured in [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html) and a typical [Linux distribution](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview).

You might argue that they shouldn't be compared but they both share a
lot of the same software (i.e [Docker in macOS with Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/docker#default) and [Docker
in Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/docker.io)).

Even then, it's not like every distributions of Linux follow a [rigid
and well-defined standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base#Limitations_on_Debian).

Some of you may have strong opinions about where software should be
installed on your system.

Perhaps, you have a rigid rule where all user-compiled software must
be stored inside a single prefix like `/usr/local/` or isolated nicely
inside their own prefixes (i.e [`/usr/local/nginx/`](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/gettingstarted/#installation), [`/opt/android/`](https://developer.android.com/studio/install#linux),
[`/home/minecraft/`](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-set-up-minecraft-server-on-ubuntu-or-debian)).

In the end, these are choices driven by opinions which are made by
different parties.

Now, as a software developer, how do you handle this mess?

Let's take a fairly simple example: a Python script.

It's nothing complicated, something that is written by someone who's
new to Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

def main():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'Counting down {i}...')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

That's a fairly simple, isn't it?

But look at the [shebang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) (`#!`), the script has a major assumption of
where Python is installed.

It expects it to be installed at `/usr/bin/python`.

However, the script uses a feature which only exists in Python 3.

If you're running a system that's in the "Python is Python 3" club, it
may work for you.

But for a lot of people, `python` is not `python3`, it's still `python2`.

```shell-session
$ python --version
Python 2.7.18
$ ./script.py
  File "./script.py", line 5
    print(f'Counting down {i}...')
                                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

The reason for this is mainly for compatibility as Python 3 introduced
a lot of features which [breaks its backwards-compatibility with
Python 2](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/Migration+to+Python+3).

To fix this issue, the shebang must use `/usr/bin/python3`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

def main():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'Counting down {i}...')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Now, you encounter a different issue: Some people use various flavors
of BSDs (including macOS) instead of Linux.

```shell-session
$ ./script.py
zsh: ./script.py: bad interpreter: /usr/bin/python3: no such file or directory
```

Unlike Linux, BSDs has a monolithic approach where it is not just a
kernel but also encapsulates everything which makes a complete BSD
system.

In this case, "everything" could be anything from the basic core
utilities (`cat`, `grep`, `ls`, etc.) to [an audio server](https://man.openbsd.org/sndiod.8) or even [a
ready-to-use HTTP server](https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8).

This is why Linux distributions exists, someone need to construct a
complete system with the Linux kernel and additional essential
components.

Because of BSD's monolithic approach, third-party software are always
installed under a separate prefix (such as `/usr/local/`) because `/usr/`
is occupied by software provided by the operating system.

However, you can't always assume that the software will be in
`/usr/local/`.

In macOS which lacks an official package manager from Apple, macOS
users uses a third-party package manager such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/),
and [pkgsrc](https://www.pkgsrc.org/) which installs software [in](https://guide.macports.org/chunked/reference.variables.html) [different](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/configuring.html) [places](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-should-i-install-homebrew-in-the-default-location) within the
filesystem.

In a NetBSD system, there are two prefixes for third-party software:

- The [`/usr/pkg/` prefix](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/files.html) for software that are installed by
  pkgsrc.
- The `/usr/local/` prefix for software that are compiled and
  installed by the user.

With this new knowledge and realisation of the issue, you look around
to find if there's a simple solution.

After all, this should be a solved problem, right?

After a while, you'll find [env](https://man.openbsd.org/env.1) which is a loose convention adopted by
[most](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=env&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+13.0-RELEASE+and+Ports&arch=default&format=html) [\*nix](https://ss64.com/osx/env.html) [systems](https://nixdoc.net/man-pages/HP-UX/man1/env.1.html).

`/usr/bin/env` is a program that will direct the user to run the right
program, no matter how the system is configured. Just give it a name
of the executable and it will find and execute it for you.

Perfect, simply replace your `/usr/bin/python3` with `/usr/bin/env
python3` and now it works.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def main():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'Counting down {i}...')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Oh no, you realize another issue: the script requires at least Python
3.6 because it uses [f-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/).

```shell-session
$ python3 --version
Python 3.5.9
$ ./script.py
  File "./script.py", line 5
    print(f'Counting down {i}...')
                                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Well, as the developer, you can choose to be ignorant and simply
state: "Your system is obselete if it doesn't have at least Python
3.6".

Even then, what about system distributions that ships multiple versions
of Python?

Package repositories such as the ones used in macOS Homebrew, FreeBSD,
and OpenBSD ships multiple versions of Python, Ruby, Node, PHP, and
others.

```shell-session
$ uname -s
OpenBSD
$ pkg_info -Q python
...
python-2.7.18p1
python-3.8.10
python-3.9.5
...
$ type -a python3
python3 not found
$ type -a python3.8
python3.8 is /usr/local/bin/python3.8
$ type -a python3.9
python3.9 is /usr/local/bin/python3.9
```

The binaries for them are typically separated using the version as a
suffix (i.e `python37`, `python38`, `python39`)

So, how do you assume what `python3` will be?

- Is `python3` the latest version?
- Is it something in between that's chosen by the system
  administrator?
- Is it the oldest available version for compatibility?
- Does it even exist at all?

As you can see, this is the very issue with traditional software
deployment and why it can feel ancient at times.

You would like to believe that the solution simple and common.
However, as you gaze down the abyss of software deployment, you start
to realize that it is bottomless.

We haven't started using third-party Python libraries or even native
libraries.

This is just a simple script which requires a Python interpreter
that's at least version 3.6.

In many ways, this was someone's "Hello, World!".

- What if we require libraries like [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)?
- What if we require programs like [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)?
- What if we require data files like game assets?

This is a universal issue that affects everyone.

From the first-year computer science student to the experienced
veteran administrator, no one is able to pursue their adventures
without having to plunge deep into the abyss of software deployment.

# The problem with traditional packages

Most system distributions ships third-party software.

They could be [a recipe](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/#ports-using) that the user can execute to download, compile,
and install third-party software.

```shell-session
$ cd /usr/ports/misc/hello/
$ make
===>  License GPLv3+ accepted by the user
===>   hello-2.10_1 depends on file: /usr/local/sbin/pkg - found
=> hello-2.10.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist in /usr/ports/distfiles/.
=> Attempting to fetch https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/hello/hello-2.10.tar.gz
hello-2.10.tar.gz                                      708 kB 3368 kBps    00s
===> Fetching all distfiles required by hello-2.10_1 for building
===>  Extracting for hello-2.10_1
=> SHA256 Checksum OK for hello-2.10.tar.gz.
===>  Patching for hello-2.10_1
===>   hello-2.10_1 depends on package: gmake>=4.3 - found
...
===>  Configuring for hello-2.10_1
...
===>  Building for hello-2.10_1
...
====> Compressing man pages (compress-man)
$ doas make install
===>  Installing for hello-2.10_1
...
$ hello
Hello, world!
```

Or, they could be [a binary package](https://rpm.org/about.html) which the user can easily install
with a tool.

```shell-session
$ doas pkg install hello
Updating HardenedBSD repository catalogue...
HardenedBSD repository is up to date.
All repositories are up to date.
The following 1 package(s) will be affected (of 0 checked):

New packages to be INSTALLED:
        hello: 2.10_1 [HardenedBSD]

Number of packages to be installed: 1

56 KiB to be downloaded.

Proceed with this action? [y/N]: y
[1/1] Fetching hello-2.10_1.txz: 100%   56 KiB  56.9kB/s    00:01
Checking integrity... done (0 conflicting)
[1/1] Installing hello-2.10_1...
[1/1] Extracting hello-2.10_1: 100%
$ hello
Hello, world!
```

These packages are maintained by the [humble package maintainers](https://nm.debian.org/public/people/dm_all/) who
risk their lives deep within the abyss in order to help users install
third-party software with little to no pain.

Often times, package maintainers are required to [write patches](https://salsa.debian.org/apache-team/apache2/-/tree/master/debian/patches) to make
software work.

With the Python script example we did, they might write a patch to
make it use the exact version of Python and explicitly declare which
version of Python is required for the package.

For a lot of people, this works just fine.

Simply install the software you need from the package manager present
in your system.

But here's the issue, what if the software is not available from the
package manager?

Well, as a user, you have two choices:

- Compile and install it by hand.
- Dive into the abyss and become a package maintainer.

None of the two choices are particularly good.

Becoming a package maintainer is hard as you have to be ready for the
following:

- Follow the latest version of the software.
- Write patches to make it work.
- In addition, follow the dependencies of the software.
- Write patches to make the dependencies work.
- And repeat.

If you compile and install it by hand, you're on your own:

- You have the responsibility of maintaining the software locally.
- You have to make sure that it doesn't conflict with anything on the
  system.
- You have to make sure that the dependencies that it requires are
  there.

Essentially, you have to become the package maintainer for your own
system and what if you need it in another system? Tough luck.

This issue has spawned three new trends:

- The infamous `curl | sh` installer.
- Package managers which are specific to a particular programming
  language (i.e [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/))
- Using containers as a medium to deliver and run software.

# The problem with `curl | sh` installers and language-specific package managers

The `curl | sh` installer is simply a small script that checks the state
of your system and perform the proper installation procedure based on
your system.

The main problem with `curl | sh` is [their unsafe nature](https://github.com/djm/pipe-to-sh-poc).

As the script is able to [do anything](https://git.yukiisbo.red/-/snippets/6) to your system, it is no
different to a [Self-XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-XSS) attack.

Because it is a shell script, it cannot be limited to only perform the
tasks necessary to achieve the goal of installing the software.

The programming language specific package managers has the issue of
limited reach.

For example, if you're installing a library to interact with a MySQL
database, you might need to have the necessary MySQL native libraries
to be installed which is out of reach for the language specific
package managers.

However, both have share a major issue due to the lack of isolation:
file conflicts.

For example, you've installed the [Docker SDK for Python](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) via pip but
you need to install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) via your system's package manager.

As Docker compose requires the Docker SDK, it also need the SDK to be
installed from the system's package manager.

The Docker SDK package from the system's package manager cannot be
installed because it is conflicting with the Docker SDK installed by
pip.

Or, it will install but you will have two separate versions of the
same package which will cause weird issues: Which version of the
Docker SDK will docker-compose use?

The common solution for this is to install it on separated prefixes.

For example, in Python, software developers typically setup separate,
local, and isolated prefixes called [Virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

The same mechanic is present in `curl | sh` installers, they commonly
use local separate prefixes (i.e `~/.cargo/` which is used by [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).

# The problem with containers

Application containers such as Docker, [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/), [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) and [AppImage](https://appimage.org/)
require some form of file system isolation.

This is because they not only ship the software but also an entire
system tailored for running the software.

You can see this in action with [Docker images](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) which is a tarball
archive of a tailored Linux system made to run a specific piece of
software.

In macOS, they use something similar called [Application bundles](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_(macOS)>) which
are just folders filled with the necessary data files, libraries, and
binaries.

This means that software that are distributed through these mediums
takes a lot of storage space.

For a lot of people, this is not an issue because for them storage is
cheap.

However, as someone who has lived their life in Indonesia with slow
4G, most of my computing time is taken by the simple task of
downloading software.

To mitigate the issue, they have solutions which reduces the download
size:

- Docker images are composed of layers which can be shared across
  images.
- macOS provides [Frameworks](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemFrameworks/SystemFrameworks.html) which are simply bundles of popular
  libraries which third-party applications can use.
- Flatpak share a similar system to macOS framework called [Runtimes](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/basic-concepts.html#runtimes).

But in the end, these are still compromises and they won't guarantee
that you won't redownload the same files.

# Closing

As you can see, the current method of installing software is
fundamentally flawed as it requires knowing the state of the
system which will guide you to make the necessary changes that allows
the software to be installed.

Package managers simply automate the installation process to the point
where anyone can install easily without having to know much about the
system.

However, package managers can only target a specific system (i.e
Ubuntu or Arch) and the same packages can't be shared between
different systems (ex. you can't use Arch packages in Ubuntu).

`curl | sh` installers are another form of automation with the caveat
that they have unlimited reach and control on the system which is
fundamentally unsafe.

Ultimately, they can't be trusted to only perform the tasks required
to install the software but this unlimited reach is required in order
for it to know the current state of your system.

Programming language specific package managers doesn't really solve
this issue as they have a very limited reach by design in order to not
break your system. They only care about the environment for the
specific programming language it was made for.

Application containers and bundles are working around the issue by
shipping a complete system with the software you need. This results in
wasting a lot of resources which renders it unaccessible to a lot of
people.

There are plenty more of other issues with the current methods such as
the requirement of trusting the humble package maintainers.

There have been cases where you can't trust them like the [chromium
binary blob scandal](https://www.theregister.com/2015/06/26/googles_not_listening_binary_blob_banished_from_chromium_build/) that has impacted Debian.

This demonstrate the fact that a malicious agent only need to attack
the few humble package maintainers.

As a user, it's not easy to audit binaries especially when [they're not
reproducible](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds).

You can choose to build and install everything from source like [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/)
but that takes [a huge chunk of time](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2020/03/30/big-project-build-times-chromium/) which is a luxury that not
everyone has.

You can build your own trusted build cluster and share the resulting
binaries but that costs money to buy the necessary hardware and labor
to maintain it.

In the end, I hope this is enough for you to consider that there's a need
for a new way of installing software.

In the next article, we will explore how Nix solves all of the
fundamental issues with traditional software deployment by introducing
a new model called functional software deployment.
