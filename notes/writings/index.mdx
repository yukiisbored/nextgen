Hello world, I'm back with more text.

I hope you don't miss me while I'm gone.

Though, I really doubt that you even realize I'm here.

Who knows, really?

So, anyway, I started this [writefreely](https://github.com/writeas/writefreely) instance mainly because I want
an improved blogging/writing experience which integrates with the
Fediverse.

I'm rather tired of static site generators. They always feel too
static and lack interactivity which made writing not satisfying for me
as I have no idea what people think about my writings.

I find myself preferring to write more stuff on Mastodon than my blog
mainly because of the interactivity that I get vs my old static blog.

I hope that you've enjoyed my shitty long texts as there would
hopefully be more.

The static blog will stay just as an archive, maybe.

So, this is writings, a place where I post long text onto. I hope it
serves you well.

My style of writing will be very casual with some f-bombs peppered in.
I wouldn't try to pretend to be serious like some sort of wiki page
since well, I suck at it and it just wouldn't be me anyway.

That's it really, See ya soon.

I'm always available at `@yuki_is_bored@bsd.network`.
